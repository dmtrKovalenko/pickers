This is a continuation of the good old [material-ui-pickers]() or `@pickers/material-ui` project from the same author [@dmtrKovalenko](https://twitter.com/dmtrKovalenko). The obvious question will be – "why the completely new project with a new name, repository, and domain?". The answer is the Material UI core team. Let me tell you the story:
In January 2020 I joined the Material-UI core team to work part-time (then full time) on the pickers and core code. We've done really a lot of progress on [v4](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui-pickers/issues/1293)! And as a result of this work, we decided to merge [pickers repo](https://github.com/mui-org/core-plus-pickers) into the Material-UI core.

But there is no result of merging pickers into the main repository as for 3 months. There was no stable release for mostly a year, that leads to the malicious dependencies installed by `@pickers/material-ui@3.2.10`. And what is more interesting – `DateRangePicker` component that was MIT licensed in pickers alpha will become paid after the merge.

So, this project is just a continuation of the pickers project, but independent, open-source, and with the original author view on date & time picking experience. So for Material-UI, this project is probably just an alternate way of evolution Date & Time Pickers. For other UI ouputs we are going to use the current experience to build the best date & time pickers.
