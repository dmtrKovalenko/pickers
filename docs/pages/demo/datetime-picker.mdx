# Date & Time picker

This component combines date & time pickers. It allows to select both date and time with the same control.

**Note:** This component is not listed in [material design guidelines](https://material.io/components/)

## Basic usage

Allows choosing date then time. There are too many views, so tabs are required to visually distinguish date/time steps.

<Example source={BasicDateTimePicker} />

## Responsiveness

The date time picker component is designed and optimized for the device it runs on.

- The "Mobile" version works best for touch devices and small screens.
- The "Desktop" version works best for mouse devices and large screens.

By default, the `DateTimePicker` component uses a `@media (pointer: fine)` media query to determine which version to use.
This can be customized by `desktopModeMediaQuery` prop.

## Date & Time validation

It is possible to restrict date and time selection in two ways:

- using `minDateTime`/`maxDateTime`, you can restrict time selection before or after a particular moment in time
- using `minTime`/`maxTime`, you can disable selecting times before or after a certain time each day respectively
