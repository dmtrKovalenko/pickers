# Time Picker

Time pickers let user select a single time (in the hours:minutes format).
The selected time is indicated by the filled circle at the end of the clock hand.

## Basic usage

A time picker should adjust to a userâ€™s preferred time setting, i.e. the 12-hour or 24-hour format.

<Example source={BasicTimePicker} />

## Responsiveness

The time picker component is designed and optimized for the device it runs on.

- The "Mobile" version works best for touch devices and small screens.
- The "Desktop" version works best for mouse devices and large screens.

By default, the `TimePicker` component uses a `@media (pointer: fine)` media query to determine which version to use.
This can be customized by `desktopModeMediaQuery` prop.

## Static mode

It is possible to render any picker inline. This will be really helpful to build custom popover/modal containers.
For that use `variant="static"`.

## Seconds

Seconds input can be used for selection of a precise time point.
